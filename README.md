Energy Performance Analysis of Buildings Based on Key Parameters

- Collaborated in a team of four for our final project in Data & Society (DIDA 325).
- Conducted data cleaning, data manipulation, data visualization, and regression analysis using Python.
- Simulated the role of a government agency researching building characteristics to optimize energy efficiency, identifying factors influencing energy consumption across various building types.
- Utilized Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and statsmodels for analysis and visualization.
- Here's the data we used to complete this analysis: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/242/energy+efficiency
